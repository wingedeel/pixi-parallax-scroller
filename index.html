<!--
	  - Calling a function with the new keyword in front of it 
	  causes it to be treated as a constructor.
	  - The constructor will have its 'this' variable bound to a fresh object
	  This new object will be returned from the call.
	  - An object created with new is said to be an instance of its constructor.
	  - It is a convention to capitalize the names of constructors so that they are easily distinguished from other functions.

	  	function Rabbit(type) {
		  this.type = type;
		}

		var killerRabbit = new Rabbit("killer");
		var blackRabbit = new Rabbit("black");
		console.log(blackRabbit.type);
		// → black
		
	  - Constructors (in fact, all functions) automatically get a property named prototype, which by default holds a plain, empty object that derives from Object.prototype. 
	  - So to add a speak method to rabbits created with the Rabbit constructor, we can simply do this:

		Rabbit.prototype.speak = function(line) {
		  console.log("The " + this.type + " rabbit says '" +
		              line + "'");
		};
		blackRabbit.speak("Doom...");
		// → The black rabbit says 'Doom...'
